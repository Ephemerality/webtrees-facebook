Install the module by extracting/cloning the directory with the name `facebook` inside ```/modules_v3/```.\r\n2. In the 'administration' section of your webtrees site, visit the 'Modules' page and check the box to\r\n   enable the 'Facebook' module and then click 'Save'.\r\n3. If you don't already have a Facebook application setup for the site, visit\r\n   https://developers.facebook.com/apps and set one up by clicking 'Create New App' and specifying an\r\n   App Name. Once the App is created, indicate that you want to integrate with Facebook as a 'Website\r\n   with Facebook Login' and provide the URL to your webtrees site.\r\n4. Specify the Facebook API App ID and Secret at ```{WEBTREES_ROOT}/module.php?mod=facebook&mod_action=admin```\r\n   which is accessible as a 'Facebook' link from the bottom of the administration menu.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues ##\r\n* If a user logs in with a Facebook account which uses a different email address than their existing\r\n  webtrees email address, a second account will be created for the same individual. If administrator\r\n  approval is required for new accounts, the administrator can delete the new account and link the\r\n  existing account to the user's Facebook account. The administrator can also link existing users to\r\n  their Facebook accounts in advance (where possible) to avoid this situation.\r\n* There is no comment field during registration with a Facebook account.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
